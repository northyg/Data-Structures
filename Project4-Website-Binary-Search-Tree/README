Assignment excerpt:

Data Structures: Write a C++ program that implements a binary search tree. The binary search tree should be a non-linear 
implementation (using left and right pointers). The underlying data may be stored as a struct or class. 
Evaluate the performance of storing and retrieving items from this tree. Monitor the height of the tree and determine
how that relates to the number of items. If the number of items is 100 and the height is 90, we know that we do not have
a relatively balanced tree.
