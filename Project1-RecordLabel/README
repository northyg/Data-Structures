Fall 2019 - Data Structures - Programming Assignment 1: 

For the first programming assignment, we are going to create a program that helps a new record label
(e.g., CS_Record_Label) to keep track of their artists and the most popular songs produced by that artist as part of this record
label.  

Your primary job will be to create an Abstract Data Type (ADT)  for a CS_Record_Label program. The data member should be a
head pointer to a LLL of all of the artists on this label. Each node will have a pointer to another linear linked list of the
songs from that artist, organized by the most popular to the least. When songs change in popularity, your code will need to
reorganize the data in the linear linked lists.
